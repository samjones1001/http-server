<p>In Flanders fields the poppies blow</p>
<p>Between the crosses, row on row,</p>
<p>That mark our place; and in the sky</p>
<p>The larks, still bravely singing, fly</p>
<p>Scarce heard amid the guns below.</p>
</br>
<p>We are the Dead. Short days ago</p>
<p>We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,</p>
<p>Loved and were loved, and now we lie</p>
<p>In Flanders fields.</p>
</br>
<p>Take up our quarrel with the foe:</p>
<p>To you from failing hands we throw</p>
<p>The torch; be yours to hold it high.</p>
<p>If ye break faith with us who die</p>
<p>We shall not sleep, though poppies grow</p>
<p>In Flanders fields.</p>
